## Description

Another web-app based test? Why?

The core motivation behind building this was to put more reps in with JavaScript, and specifically to practice creating, modifying, and removing elements from the DOM. I also welcomed another opportunity to practice styling a page that I had built from scratch in CSS.

With regards to learning JavaScript, I took away a great deal from this assignment. Among these was using forEach to iterate on a collection of nodes, and sorting objects within an array using ternary operators, neither of which I had attempted previously.

## Credits

I used many instructional resources to bridge the knowledge gaps. Chief among them was a YouTube tutorial on a similar project, which I utilized to better understand how to switch between questions.

As well as many other guides and walkthroughs of various methods, styles, etc. Most notable are these:
